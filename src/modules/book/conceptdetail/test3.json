Ensure that your explanation directly describes the key concept without framing it as third-person commentary or narrative. Use clear, concise language to convey the information, maintaining a logical flow and coherence with smooth transitions between paragraphs. The notes provided are strictly for contextual understanding and should only be used where they are relevant to the book and the key concept being explored. However, they should not be treated as a source of information. You should rely on your own knowledge base to explain the concept and not use the notes as a foundation for building your logic. Format the output using HTML with paragraphs, lists, bold, and italic elements. Avoid including any extraneous tags or text. Do not include reminders of the user's instructions or make any self-references or apologies."
